Multi-Step Form with Validation

📌 Description

This is a dynamic multi-step form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their details across multiple steps with real-time validation at each step. The form ensures correct input formats, prevents future dates in the Date of Birth field, and maintains data using local storage for persistence.

✨ Features

✔ Multi-Step Navigation – Users can smoothly navigate between form steps using “Next” and “Back” buttons.
✔ Input Validation – Ensures a valid email format, 10-digit phone number, and prevents future dates in the Date of Birth field.
✔ Local Storage Persistence – Saves form progress so users can resume after a page refresh.
✔ Summary View – Displays a summary of user input before final submission.
✔ Responsive Design – Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
